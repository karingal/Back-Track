# Back-Track
Preforming a "backtrack" action on B-trees , AVL trees.
Backtrack(S) â€“ This method reverts the last Insert(S,x) performed on the data structure, and return the
data-structure to exactly the same state prior to that action. This means that after backtracking, the data
structure should look as if the backtracked action was never performed. If no insert actions were
performed on the data structure, then the method should not change anything in the data structure.
